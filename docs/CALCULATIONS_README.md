## 🔢 Core Valuation Models

### 1. Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC)

**What it is:** The minimum rate of return required by investors for an investment to be worthwhile.

**Formula:**
```
WACC = (Equity Weight × Cost of Equity) + (Debt Weight × Cost of Debt × (1 - Tax Rate))
```

**Example with PPL Corporation:**
```
Cost of Equity = Risk-Free Rate + Beta × Market Risk Premium
                = 4.0% + 0.8 × 6.0%
                = 8.8%

Cost of Debt (after tax) = 5.0% × (1 - 25%) = 3.75%

WACC = 60% × 8.8% + 40% × 3.75% = 6.78%
```

**Why this matters:** Any project must earn more than 6.78% to create value for shareholders.

### 2. Enterprise Present Value (EPV)

**What it is:** The total value of the company to all investors (equity + debt holders).

**Formula:**
```
EPV = Free Cash Flow / WACC
```

**Step-by-step for PPL Corporation:**
```
1. EBITDA = $3,450 million
2. Maintenance Capex = $345 million
3. Normalized EBIT = $3,450M - $345M = $3,205M
4. NOPAT = $3,205M × (1 - 25%) = $2,404M
5. Free Cash Flow = $2,404M × (1 - 15%) = $2,043M
6. EPV = $2,043M / 6.78% = $30,119M
```

**Real-world interpretation:** PPL is worth approximately $30.1 billion to all its investors.

### 3. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF)

**What it is:** The present value of all future cash flows the company will generate.

**Formula:**
```
DCF = Sum of discounted cash flows + Terminal value
```

**Example calculation:**
```
Year 1: $2,656M / 1.0678 = $2,488M
Year 2: $2,710M / (1.0678)² = $2,370M
Year 3: $2,764M / (1.0678)³ = $2,257M
Year 4: $2,819M / (1.0678)⁴ = $2,150M
Year 5: $2,876M / (1.0678)⁵ = $2,049M

Terminal Value = $2,876M × 1.02 / (0.0678 - 0.02) = $61,367M
PV of Terminal = $61,367M / (1.0678)⁵ = $39,399M

Total DCF = $2,488 + $2,370 + $2,257 + $2,150 + $2,049 + $39,399 = $50,713M
```

## 📊 Financial Ratios Explained

### Profitability Ratios

#### Return on Assets (ROA)
```
ROA = Net Income / Total Assets
```
**PPL Example:** Net Income $1,250M / Total Assets $36,550M = 3.42%

#### Return on Equity (ROE)
```
ROE = Net Income / Shareholder Equity
```
**PPL Example:** $1,250M / $16,750M = 7.46%

#### Return on Invested Capital (ROIC)
```
ROIC = NOPAT / (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)
```
**PPL Example:** $2,404M / ($36,550M - $9,000M) = 8.69%

### Liquidity Ratios

#### Current Ratio
```
Current Ratio = Current Assets / Current Liabilities
```
**Industry Standard:** > 1.5 (safe), > 1.0 (minimum)

#### Quick Ratio (Acid Test)
```
Quick Ratio = (Cash + Receivables) / Current Liabilities
```
**Industry Standard:** > 1.0 (safe), > 0.5 (minimum)

### Leverage Ratios

#### Debt-to-Equity
```
Debt-to-Equity = Total Debt / Shareholder Equity
```
**PPL Example:** $18,750M / $16,750M = 1.12x

#### Interest Coverage
```
Interest Coverage = EBITDA / Interest Expense
```
**PPL Example:** $3,450M / $380M = 9.08x
**Interpretation:** Can pay interest 9 times over

### Valuation Ratios

#### EV/EBITDA
```
EV/EBITDA = Enterprise Value / EBITDA
```
**PPL Example:** $48,869M / $3,450M = 14.2x
**Industry Comparison:** Energy infrastructure typically 8-12x

## 🎲 Monte Carlo Simulation

### What it does:
Tests thousands of possible scenarios to understand valuation uncertainty.

### How it works:
1. **Generate Random Inputs:** Vary EBITDA, beta, growth rates within realistic ranges
2. **Run Valuations:** Calculate EPV and DCF for each scenario
3. **Statistical Analysis:** Determine mean, standard deviation, confidence intervals

### Example Results:
```
Base Case EPV: $30,119M
95% Confidence Range: $25,000M - $35,000M
Probability of Positive Value: 87%
Worst Case Scenario: $18,500M
Best Case Scenario: $42,000M
```

## 📈 Scenario Analysis

### Interest Rate Changes
```
+100bps (1% increase): EPV decreases by 12%
-100bps (1% decrease): EPV increases by 14%
```

### Growth Rate Changes
```
+1% terminal growth: DCF increases by 18%
-1% terminal growth: DCF decreases by 15%
```

### EBITDA Changes
```
+10% EBITDA: EPV increases by 15%
-10% EBITDA: EPV decreases by 13%
```

## 🧮 Technical Indicators

### Simple Moving Average (SMA)
```
SMA(20) = Average of last 20 closing prices
```

### Exponential Moving Average (EMA)
```
EMA_today = (Price × 0.095) + (EMA_yesterday × 0.905)
```

### Relative Strength Index (RSI)
```
RSI = 100 - (100 / (1 + RS))
RS = Average Gain / Average Loss (14-day period)
```

**Interpretation:**
- RSI > 70: Overbought (potential sell signal)
- RSI < 30: Oversold (potential buy signal)
- RSI 50: Neutral
